OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is a computer vision library that contains various functions to perform operations on Images or videos

In Python, one can use an OpenCV library named CV2. Python does not come with cv2, so user needs to install it separately.

For Windows : 

pip install opencv-python

For Linux :

sudo apt-get install python-opencv
